	/// A notification needs to be sent to a client's webhook.
	///
	/// This event is triggered when the LSP needs to notify a client about an event
	/// via their registered webhook. The LSP must make an HTTP POST request to the
	/// provided URL with the specified headers and notification content.
	///
	/// When this event occurs, the LSP should:
	/// 1. Send an HTTP POST request to the specified webhook URL
	/// 2. Include all provided headers in the request
	/// 3. Send the JSON-serialized notification as the request body
	/// 4. Handle any HTTP errors according to the LSP's retry policy
	///
	/// The notification is signed using the LSP's node ID to ensure authenticity
	/// when received by the client. The client verifies this signature using
	/// [`parse_webhook_notification`], which guards against replay attacks and tampering.
	///
	/// If the HTTP request fails, the LSP may implement a retry policy according to its
	/// implementation preferences, but must respect rate-limiting as defined in
	/// [`notification_cooldown_hours`].

	/// has been deleted from the LSP's system and will no longer receive
	/// notifications.
	///
	/// When this event occurs, the client should:

	///
	/// This event is triggered when the LSP rejects a webhook removal
	/// via [`lsps5.remove_webhook`]. The most common scenario is attempting
	/// to remove a webhook that doesn't exist or was already removed.
	///
	/// When this event occurs, the client should:
	/// 1. Present an appropriate error message to the user
	/// 2. If the error is [`AppNameNotFound`], update any local state to
	///    reflect that the webhook does not exist on the server
	/// 3. Consider refreshing the webhook list to ensure local state
